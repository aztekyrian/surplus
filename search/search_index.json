\nWe will be using a sample Jenkins Pipeline as an example. \n\n\nA Jenkins Pipeline Example 1\n\u00b6\n\n\nOur first example here is a Jenkins Declarative Pipeline that runs a set of automated tests.\nWe want to integrate a VDB Snapshot operation and a VDB Rewind operation into this pipeline.\nThis pipeline has 3 staps - \n\n\n\n\nPre-Test : Sets up the test environment\n\n\nAutomated Test1 : Runs a set of automation tests using a Delphix VDB named \"vdb1\"\n\n\nPost-Test: Tears down the test environment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding a Delphix Snapshot Operation\n\u00b6\n\n\nLet's say, we want to modify this pipeline such that it take a snapshot of the VDB \n(vdb1)\n in Delphix before the tests run.\n\n\n\nFor this we can use the \ndxi snapshot\n cli command as follows\n\n\n\n    \n\n
